"App unreliability is being sorted. Since downloading the app, on 4 occasions it has crashed (""unable to verify your system, please try later"") meaning I had to delete the app; re-download; and re-do/re-enter all my biometrics.

On Monday of this week, I called to get it sorted, was told ""No need to ever delete/re-do everything, just call"".

Which I did today when - after just 3 days working - I again had the same message with no login or navigation options, just a frozen screen.

Just off the phone to be told ""you will in fact have to delete and reinstall""

Now - my iPhone6+ running iOS10 has not changed since Monday when I could log in (after a phone call) - I've never encountered a worse banking app in my entire life - totally unreliable, one day it might let you in, another not.    None of my other banking apps have ever failed to let me access login screen/options - only this one.      I'm going to start a diary on twitter on a daily basis to record when it does/does not work.

Very poor service. Trying to open an account with their app is painful. Maybe in year or two if they are still on the horizon it might be worth looking again at this fledgling bank.

SIMPLE NO NONSENSE ACCOUNT. Used my I-pad to open the account and found it very simple and easy to use. no issues with the app. as it went through very easily without any hitches. Received immediate confirmation of my account being opened and was immediately able to make a deposit with a 7 day window to put more money in. It was weird having to download a picture of myself and record my voice onto the account for security reasons but even that was straight forward.

nothing happened. Seems they might be running before they learn to walk. I'm not impressed!

"This is the future of Banking - NOW. Had a problem opening an account on my Android phone (due to big fingers and small keys, I think) but on an iPad the app worked fine for me. It uses face recognition, voice recognition and passwords which suits me better than having to find and use those card-readers as I usually have my voice and face with me! It only offers Savings and Mortgages but my Fixed Account gives me 3 times the interest offered by Nationwide and 10 times that of Lloyds! I like the idea of it being more like a games console than a traditional dull banking site and being able to chat to staff online or by phone 24/7 is great (other banks are available which close for the weekend!). It's new and isn't for everyone but I really do think that in the future all banks will be (and will have to be) like this. One downside: the face recognition (which isn't compulsory) keeps reminding me how ugly I am! As it's still small, it's refreshing to phone them and be on first name terms with someone who actually remembered me from our last conversation; my current international bank has a call centre in the Phillipines so not only do they not recognise me but often they don't understand me!

"Atom Bank. Saw this bank advertised in the Mail on Saturday and thought they offered a much better rate of interest on savings accounts than all high street banks. After a little bit of concern (never heard of them...) i decided to give it a go and open a fixed saver for a year. I downloaded the app on my phone and started the registration process. I had a small issue in that I left the process half way at the beginning and couldn't complete it when I tried again. I phoned their help desk and a very helpful lady (Katy I think) reset their system which allowed me to register and I then sailed through the process really easily. I was a liitle concerned, once I transferred money in as it didn't show up immediately, but I used their chat line and spoke to Danielle, who reassured me that the money would show up soon. Sure enough it did and now I have a fixed saver at a decent interest rate.

I can't begin to say how refreshing it is to deal with people, who have got their customers interests at heart..

"Atom gave me incorrect information that cost me money. Atom only give you 7 days to deposit money into your Atom account, which concerned me as I needed to move money from other savings vehicles with other providers. ""Not a problem"" they told me, ""you can open as many accounts as you like and we always notify existing customers before we reduce the interest rates we offer on any new accounts"".

Great, that should have meant that if I missed the 7 day deadline of the first account I opened, I just needed to ensure I opened another one before any reduction in interest rates were applied to new accounts.  Because, remember, they said they would notify existing customers of this.  BUT THEY DIDN'T notify anyone.  I queried this.  Two other people at Atom then subsequently confirmed that yes, existing customers WERE notified of interest rates changes.  THEY WERE WRONG.  When I eventually got a full reply from Atom, they confirmed no, it was never their intention to notify customers of interest rate changes, they just changed them when they wanted to.

So, I've been shafted basically.  I had commenced cancellations of my existing savings accounts with other providers, but the interest rate on my intended destination for this money (I.e. Atom) then reduced without my knowledge.  Contrary to what I was advised by 3 different people at Atom customer services.  Appalling service.

Waited several weeks for an update and nothing. Enquired using the app as to how things where going and if I could get a copy of the valuation, was told it would appear in the app after a couple of days . Three weeks later it's still not there.
I have now been told 5 weeks after applying (and wasting my time) that Mortgage has hit a problem and it won't be completed.

Been through the process of a mortgage application with Atom.  Very slow all the way through.  Unable to talk to anyone at Atom directly with any queries - need to go via a broker ending up with information being lost on the way. 
 
Had to change solicitors part way through the process to be eligible for the mortgage.  Took weeks to book the survey with persistent chasing.
 
Finally got the mortgage offer.  Despite having been upfront about the fact that our chain involves a new build and offering the estimated completion date - the validity of the offer falls well short of this date.  Chased (via broker etc. again v. slow) to get this corrected as information on the Atom website indicates longer validity for chains with new builds. No extension possible.

"Avoid this shambolic lender!. My newly married wife and I applied for a mortgage with Atom Bank through our broker due to their excellent rates. Our broker noted it was the first time using them but the rate was worth it - we agreed and our application commenced.

All financial documentation was collated and submitted and things moved along well with a valuation of the property carried out. We then waited over a month for a valuation report to be reviewed by the Underwriters. This was reviewed and we moved onto the next stage and within 24 hours we got a text....""Pop the bubbly heres your mortgage offer!"". We were elated.

Whilst the valuation was being reviewed Atom had appointed Gorvins Solicitors to act on our behalf (Gorvins have been excellent) and we have been progressing the legals quickly and paid search fees. Everything was looking good.

Then 24 hours after receiving our offer my broker rang me to say Atom had pulled the offer. He had no idea why and the underwriter would only communicate via email. The Atom employee merely stated to check our credit file. My wife and I still have Excellent credit scores - so this cannot be the reason.  

The following day my broker was on hold for 90 minutes to get through to someone at Atom and discuss the case. This was to no avail and now they will not even respond to his emails. Our broker is a trusted family friend who has been in the business for over 30 years and has never seen behavior like this. It is cowardly and unacceptable.

Despite all this, the App platform which Atom so proudly advertise still shows we have a mortgage offer and the next step is completion.

As a result of all this we have had to start a new mortgage application and Bank of Ireland UK are keen to work with us. 

Nonetheless, there is a good chance we will lose our first ever house buy together due to the appalling conduct of Atom Bank. My wife and I along with our broker will be issuing formal complaints to the relevant parties and will be seeking remittance for the valuation and legal fees paid to date. For a Bank seeking to enter the market to have such dire service, hide behind emails and not even give us a valid reason as to why they won't lend is beyond a joke. 

We have a 25% deposit and we are borrowing just 2 times over our annual salaries. We are good candidates and would be good business for new Bank.

Valuation survey booked 2 days later ( thought this is going well)

week 3 Broker asked for documents sent it the same day first class . 
week 4 Broker asked for documents sent it the same day first class .
week 5 Broker asked for documents sent it the same day first class .

week 7   they asked for the same  documents that i sent in week 3,4,5  because they are now out of date because of the time its taken them to  process these docs. plus documents they didnt think of asking for the first time round. 

i have had to send numerous amount of docs because they couldn't decide what they needed in the first place. 

the application is still on going after 3 months . longest remortageg process ever . i would avoid this bank at all cost. 

excuses ; due to the sheer volume of applicants its taking a long time to process the application . 

my simple solution : hire more staff to deal with it. 

atom you have failed many customers and this is only handful of people reviewing your bank. i can imagine there are 1000's of disappointed customers out there

i called them today (3 July 2017) only to be told they cant discuss mortgages as they are from the saving department and cant see what is written on my notes. Great customer service all round.

update: 3 July 2017 :  they requested my wife pre maternity pay slips 3 weeks ago and we told them that we have misplaced it and provided bank statements as a alternative. the broker told us that would be all the documents they would request and we should have a mortgage offer once they have reviewed all the documents.  they  have now come back to us  asking for pre maternity pay slips again . it wasn't available before its not going to be available now.

If you/you're partner are currently on maternity leave don't even consider using Atom; as they don't seem to understand that people do actually return to work! There many things in life that we can be discriminated against but I didn't think maternity would be one of them. Atom lack the understanding to calculate a pro rata'd salary and seem to be happy to keep asking the same questions over again. There doesn't seem any logical progression in their thought processes and even when documents are sent across it appears they just look at a selected few; gaining only half the picture. Atom have to be the most frustrating financial company I have ever dealt with. They offer the lowest mortgage rate; and almost seem surprised (and don't have the work force) to deal with the increased customers. Maybe before entering into the market a little more basic mortgage training would be a good idea to ensure that customers needs can be met. To me, as a relatively new company, this doesn't seem a good way of improve your market status. Even from this site it is evident that customer satisfaction is poor. 

I will be appealing my application only because i cant be bothered to go through the whole process again with another lender. if you are starting a new application then i would avoid this company . complete shambles.

"They can't get it right; they've had long enough.. Like many others leaving reviews, I had high hopes for this bank. However, the thing the customer sees, ie the bank's presence to the customer is the appalling app.

The app should be the priority for the roll-out (once all the financial stuff has been sorted) but it is just appalling. If you look at the App store reviews you'll see what I mean. It's like a child's plaything. People don't want silly graphics or fancy colours from a bank, they want a snappy reliable app that does the job simply and effectively. This is not what Atom have deemed to provide for their customers. It is like an art student's vanity project; all fluff and little substance. Try for instance looking at the documents that you've agreed to during signing up. They all have completely cryptic names (eg DRW34_kes298.pdf) and you have to open each one to see what's inside it. Not rocket science to give them names such as 'One year fixed rate T&Cs.pdf' is it?

I have communicated at length with them since opening an account last year (despite being astonished that their app development bunch hadn't thought of the very obvious things I was bringing up) and one or two things have been changed. However, the last time I logged in I got a load of ambiguous questions about tax and residency. I don't pay tax at the moment, so to the question 'Do you pay UK tax' I correctly answered 'No'. I was then assumed by them to be a non-UK national and was asked for proof documents etc. 

I contacted them and pointed out the poor wording on the app, told them my tax status and was assured in an email that all my details had been amended and I wouldn't be asked about it again.

Not so. I logged in a few days ago and it started to ask me about tax again. I plodded through the questions and came to 'Nationality'.

The options for 'Nationality' were countries!

So, the only option I had was 'United Kingdom' as my nationality, as the nearest thing to 'British' was 'Belize'...

I contacted them about (a) my details not being amended some months ago when I raised it with them and (b) to express my opinion that the programmer who wrote the app giving countries as answers for 'Nationality' was an idiot. There's no other word for it. 

I received a bland 'Thanks for the feedback' email (no acknowledgement that they'd said they'd changed my tax status and clearly they hadn't) and that was it.

"Disappointed and time wasted. We applied through Atom Bank for a remortgage to free up some equity in our house. The rate was competitive and the terms of the mortgage appealed to my Wife and I so we instructed our broker to progress. Affordability was fine, documentation was provided and a decision in principal was referred to the underwriters which I am told is common practice with a new mortgage lender. Digital required much more documentation than I have ever provided to a lender before, some of which was completely unnecessary. We were assigned a legal company for the conveyancing and a valuation visit was also booked. Out of the blue I received notification from the mortgage broker asking if I could explain transactions on my bank statement which showed adhoc payments being transferred to my parents....sums of money I choose to save each month, often coming back in to the account. I gave the explanation as required and thought no more of it as these payments were well within my surplus. After a week with no news I received a call from my broker advising that Digital 'didn't like the look of the payments to my parents' and had declined our application......3 weeks into the process! I am now in a position of having to push through the remortgage with another mainstream lender (whom, may I add, instantly approved us using all the same documentation) with only 3 weeks until my fixed rate ends. 

My wife and I have exemplary credit records, have never missed a payment on any debt and passed the affordability check with ease. 

Digital offer a very appealing rate but seemingly use odd criteria to determine whether or not to lend. If there was a solid reason for our rejection other than 'we don't like the look of the payments' I could appreciate their stance however I am left baffled and almost out of time......

EDIT following the Atom response and a phone call with them......

This was apparently a stress test taking into account the amount I save each month - which is obviously something I can stop immediately.

The stress test was attempted with interest rates reaching 5% which I'm sure you'll agree isn't going to happen anytime soon.

"Lovely team, but clunky app and frustrating user experience. I joined Atom because of the decent interest rates on their fixed savings accounts and because the concept of app-based banking seemed promising.

Having experienced a year (and a bit) of using their app, I'm sad to report that the whole concept really doesn't work. As others have reported, Atom make a big thing about their app's animated graphical interface and unconventional technology (like user verification via face and voice recognition). Unfortunately, almost every element of this design makes the experience slower and more frustrating compared to equivalent apps from the established high street banks. 

Getting into the app is slow - for example it only takes around 14 seconds to access to the Lloyds banking app with fingerprint ID on iPhone vs more than double that time to access the Atom app on the same device. Once you're in, I find the user interface to be confusing and slow (animated floaty bubbles rather than simple clear lists.. why?). Almost everything about the experience feels frustrating compared to a normal bank - for example, when your savings account matures, you have a window of just a few days to nominate an account using the app (I tried, but it crashed and I gave up!), after which you have to call Atom and wait in a queue, before painstakingly going through the details on the phone. 

On the plus side, when you do speak to the Atom call centre, they seem friendly, knowledgeable and genuinely keen to help. However, the fact that I've had to make multiple calls in one year to sort out problems on just a couple of savings accounts highlights the issues with the app.

Do the good savings rates justify the hassle of using the App?

"Good interest rates and an innovative approach mired by pretentious app design. Atom have decent fixed-term interest rates, and I appreciate their attempts to innovate in this very stale sector. The app is better-designed than most bank apps, but that's a very low bar as most bank apps are terrible. Overall the design needs tightening up a lot: It has too many flashy animations, which distract rather than aiding the user. There's often no clear information hierarchy, and the floating bubbles, while novel, don't make it easy to figure out how to navigate where you want to go. It's a banking app not a band website, I just want to get my banking done quickly and easily, and I'd appreciate if the design wouldn't get in my way.

"BEWARE - They take 5% as MINIMUM on Credit Cards and make traditional banks look like Angels. I applied for a re-mortgage with Atom Bank via a broker. The worst experience of my life. All went through fine at application, passed affordability, so a little surprised to later have it turned down on... affordability!

Our mortgage broker claimed to have 3 others turned down at similar times and then had a nightmare trying to get any sense out of Atom so I went elsewhere through same broker and... it went though first time for the full amount.

So to summarise my experience:
Credit cards... Atom don't make it clear in my opinion that they will take 5% as a monthly minimum on ALL credit cards.

When I pointed out that their calculator or policy docs didn't state this 5% fact - they said it did and even gave me a screenshot.  It does if you use simple view on their calculator...(and its hidden in a tooltip) but anybody using detailed view better watch out... because it isn't there.... they said they would put this forward for fixing... but have they after 2 months ... what do you think! I couldn't find reference to 5% minimum on credit cards anywhere in their policy docs at the time of my application and I can't today.

The calculator... gave me no accurate indication whatsoever. Even after Atom had stipulated a rejection - their calculator was still stating I was good for over £100k more than I had requested!!!!

Underwriters.. they seem to be in a world of their own. I submitted to Atom Bank a Subject Access Request which took them the full 40 days of 40 to receive! I saw the underwriters notes and they clearly were plucking numbers out of a hat.

Valuation... came in £30k under... okay that can happen anywhere I suppose... but....when I applied elsewhere thier valuers agreed with what was stated.. only 6 weeks later.

For a property close in value to the national average, £30k is a significant difference, but Atom failed to provide this information when they had it. Should they have been transparent it would likely have put an immediate end to any further proceedings with them... but they didn't... so it proceeded via their solicitor... which leads me to...

Communication. Not only did my mortgage broker struggle to get any sense out of Atom, Atom didn't appear to communicate with their solicitors. Even though they knew they weren't prepared to lend their solicitors continued to bombard me with request after request for signed and witnessed documents which were all sent off (at my time and expense) recorded delivery.. all whilst Atom knew they weren't lending. This is the most frustrating part! A complete waste of my time which Atom haven't to this day acknowleged or dealt with.

I doubt Atom Bank will respond to this feedback... which in my view says it all.  If you have any credit cards whatsoever or are reliant on a chain - consider your options carefully before considering Atom for a mortgage.

"Good Remortgage- Let down by Solicitors. I had remortgaged with Atom bank. The rates were decent and the L&C brokers were splendid. Very impressed  with the speed and quality of the whole process, until I get the mortgage offer. Then comes the solicitor (chosen by atom bank) LMS & TCS. A simple search in internet shows that these guys are simply the worst in business and yet  atom bank (and few other banks as well, as I can see from those reviews) chose to use them. No way they can be contacted by Emails or phones. I was under constant stress that whether the mortgage would be completed on time. Anyway, long story short, remortgage completed, but really felt that it did not worth the stress I went through.

"Not as smart as they believe they are.. The interest rate is excellent, but frankly it's the only good point ( important none the less).
It claims to be unique in the way it uses an app. I can't see any difference in operation to both my other internet based bank accounts that have been doing it for many years.
Both present my account details in much better and presentable ways than Atom.
To use a well worn phrase it's ""presentation over content"". The bubbles are just plain annoying and as a result of their design, you can't even see all your accounts on one page. And what details they do provide are incomplete.
Even the user definable bubble titles are so restrictive in choice they are meaningless.
The storage area that files your correspondence, provides totally unreadable titles.
I can't imagine a more important web site that needs clear, accurate and easy to find detail.
They need to recruit some professional designers who are perhaps old enough to have a bank account. The site looks like it was given to the local school to design.
Including their new personality they have just recruited as a marketing tool, they should remind themselves they are running a bank, our money needs to be looked after by professionals.
At the moment it doesn't provide full banking services, when it does unless it changes considerably I won't be moving my bank account.
So.... good interest rates, covered by the FSCS so based on that alone it would be 5 stars. But as they are so keen to be judged on their new modern look, so just 3 stars.
EDIT...
I thought after a couple years of use I would update my thoughts.
Basically nothing has improved or changed.
I considered the interest rate the ONLY positive point for the app, but even that varies so much that you have to catch it on the right day.

Quick tip..... If you have a bubble maturing, check the current interest level a week before. You might be lucky like I was and find a slightly higher bubble rate that is not available on maturity date. Just open it up ready, transfer the maturing funds to your proper bank then transfer those funds into the already open bubble.
I use the word bubble deliberately in a disparaging way.
The app remains the slowest in every way compared to all my proper banking apps and frankly any other app.
The overall format remains the worst.
The textual descriptions of the vaulted files remains ridiculous.
Calculating your total funds remains convuluted, counting up the bubbles.
Interest rate not always the best anymore.
I consider it border line bad enough to abandon it and lose the small margins.
If I'd been unlucky enough to experience any of the technical problems others have on here, I would run a mile.

In addition to the above the downfall of this bank is that the customer service is not 100 per cent.  2018 nearly every company logs and minutes every call. Not Atom. Only if one makes a change. So when I was told something by the customer services member of staff, there was no trace of this conversation. It also meant my interest was not paid as it should have been. 

I feel the customer services operators don’t take the role as seriously as they should the above query meant I was on the ‘phone for over half an hour and I repeated myself a lot and in the end spoke to the manager, which really was no use as she didn’t know herself why the error occurred.

"Sadly it’s not all good news. Sadly, following the death of my father-in-law I had 12 different financial organisations to deal with during the probate process. Of the 12 Atom was the worst by far, their process more complicated, slower and more stressful than any of the others. They even returned  my critical and valuable probate documents to me without so much as a complements slip to identify who sent them (as opposed to the 11 others who included helpful and supportive information). At last when the final Grant of Approval came through it took 3weeks for the money to be transferred  (it was a week or so  with everyone else) and then only after I had chased them for their inactivity. It was with real releif I closed my father-in-laws account...and my own too. It seems to me that in Atoms attempts to be lean and efficient ignore the needs of more complex and sensitive matters, despite their legal obligations to do this.

"Rates good, but be careful of timing!. The rates with Atom are good, if timed right. They seem to have a very chaotic approach to interest rates, and gambling on the right time to invest any money is an issue. 

Being an existing customer, you would think that Atom may communicate these new rates in advance to customers both existing and prospective, or at very least that they would email you when new improved rates were in place, but no. So like me, if you scan the ‘Hot Deals’ app daily, some kind soul may let you know about these rates, leaving you cursing that you just invested a sizeable sum just a few days previously (for a year) like me. 

After contacting customer services about this, they seem as in the dark as everyone else, only finding out about new rates at the same time as customers?!

I find it odd that you wouldn’t publish rate rises to your loyal customers, especially good improved rates, as you may wish to invest, but as Atom only do fixed term accounts, your time of investing is vital. 

I will certainly carefully consider carefully my decision to (re)invest with Atom. 

Communication about important issues such interest rates is severely lacking, but emails about other less important matters do occasionally land in my inbox. 

The app is frustrating at times, the facial ID login is near useless for me, I managed to get it to a pin code finally after a lot of issues, and this is much easier. I still can’t fathom why Touch ID (for iPhone users) isn’t used, as this is used for 99% of my other accounts (including the very security conscious first direct), and seems to be the industry norm. The app itself is in my view needlessly ‘gamey’ with floating bubbles etc. My main reason for investing is interest rates and returns on my money, not because my money is floating in bubbles, or you can choose colours etc. I appreciate they need a USP, but this is now looking a bit tired. 

So overall, I would say great for rates (if you’re lucky and time investing right). But for customer communication I would say they’re not great.

The application process was somewhat annoying. Choosing a password was straight forward, then a request for a facial recognition, all ok. But setting up the voice recognition was so, so, hard, I forget the countless times I tried to record their security statement. I actually gave up, on my first attempt to register, the second time, no better. On the third attempt, because pass phrase 1 and 2 had by then been ‘accepted’ after three more times of repeating the phrase, I actually managed to register.

Once set up, Access is easy, and monies transferred seamlessly in seconds.

Ok....but..... Thought that the account opening process was long winded. I don't trust biometric security and would never choose to use it. I can carry passwords in my head easily and they are instantly available. So why force applicants to provide biometric data if they are not going to use it? I also didn't like the way that I had to wait 30 mins before trying to record the biometrics when it failed the first time. It would also help applicants if the supplied account number and sort code for payments included information that the account number related to the applicant...not Atom Bank. I contacted Atom's CS by Chat and it took a long time to establish that fact.

"Opened a 1-year savings account. Opened a 1-year savings account.  Whilst the interest rate was clearly stated as fixed the restriction on further deposits is hidden away on the web site (rather once you select the product you have to go to the definitions tab where it's stuck in the middle of the second paragraph).  They do also mention this on their main page if you scroll past the products, but frankly I challenge anyone to go 4-5 pages past the product they are interested in and read the rest of the web site!  Such a key aspect of the product should be clearly listed.

I also asked whether they could switch me to another account which allowed future pay in as I wish to invest but that was not possible.

So called them to cancel since there is a 14-day cooling off period for all online services only to be told they don't have this.  I'm pretty sure they will relent since this is a central part of the 2014 consumer contract legislation however is frustrating when organisations feel they can just ignore the law.  Default 1-star review for such organisations.

Frankly at this point they could offer the best rate in the world, I won't ever use them again.


Edit: 

In response to the Atom feedback:
From the Citizens Advise Website (CAB):

""14 days is the minimum cooling-off period that a seller must give you. Make sure you check the terms and conditions in case they’ve given you more time to change your mind - many choose to do so.""

Am confused, either the CAB is wrong or you are ignoring the law?  What am I missing?

I discovered Atom, their interest rate exceeded most other savings account. I read reviews as a digital app bank was new to me. All my concerns were allayed, the most important being that my money was protected by FSCS.
I downloaded the app and set up my account. I found the process both easy, user friendly and I was impressed by the security. I was sent texts and emails by Atom to confirm that my account was active. I then arranged for the money to be transferred to Atom. Again Atom sent me an email and text to confirm that my money had been deposited with them. I had opted for interest to be paid monthly into another of my bank accounts and I was able to select the date I wished the interest to be paid and a confirmation of the receiving bank account.
I had one query that I wished to personally speak to an adviser. I rang Atom, NO automated service, unusual in this day and age. I spoke to an adviser who answered my query efficiently and politely.

"Customer service?. I've had an Atom account since their very first days. I've had several accounts since.

I received a few texts in the run up to maturity of an account, about 2 weeks ago. According to Atom they were 'pulling together a choice of options' and '.. We'll be in touch soon', this was on 26 January.

Roll on today, maturity day and I've not heard from Atom since 26 January!? I goto my account to find it's in a holding account as I've not let them know what I wanted to do! 

I've been waiting for your contact to let me know what my options were. But as an option is to withdraw all my money and take it elsewhere, I'll do that thanks.

Atom seem to be very good promising a 'choice of options', but reality is you're on your own. 

Thanks for the heads up on my 'options', that appears to be an account paying 0.75%. I wonder how long my money would have languished here had I not looked? There was me (naively) thinking Atom had some special loyal customer accounts with a special interest rate!! Instead, take away 1.2% of what I was on. Hmm.

Apart from some good rates, if it wasn't for these, I'd not touch Atom with a barge pole. I'll certainly consider more carefully if I bother with Atom again.

"Splitting an account at maturity. Firstly, I have never managed to get the facial recognition logon to work. However, the app does allow me to enter a 6-digit passcode so this isn't a major issue.

My bigger issue is that, when my 1-year fixed rate saver matured the other day, a message on my phone told me that I would be able to split it, so that one part went into a new saver, the remainder to an external account. Since I have more than £85000 in the account this is what I wanted to do. I guess it's there somewhere in the app but I couldn't find it. When I went to apply for a new fixed term saver it never asked me how much I wanted to put into it; it merely moved the whole lot. This isn't what I wanted. Frustrating or what.

"Consent to Let declined. I took out my first mortgage with Atom. It was a very easy smooth process, loved the app- how it kept you up to date, the rates were also great. However my circumstances in life have changed since taking out the mortgage. I'm aware that Atom don't offer a BTL mortgage which at the time of me taking it out was fine as I had no plans to rent out the property. I however have met someone and I am looking to move into his house to eventually, hopefully start a family. I applied for a consent to let from Atom but have been declined because my reasons apparently aren't strong enough. Because the flat I live in and have a mortgage for has 2 bedrooms therefore it makes no sense apparently to move out of there, we should live there and have a family rather than in my partner's house. I have had my property valued and went back to Atom to tell them that I now have at least 25% equity in it, plus I've had a rental value which more than covers my mortgage payments however they still are declining me. Sadly, I'm going to have to pay the hefty early repayment charge and remortgage with someone else. Very disappointed as I was so happy with Atom and their processes. I know a lot of people ""risk it"" and just let out their property without telling the bank, however I feel like I'm being penalised for being honest and doing the right thing!",0.21,"'ease of use : easy to use' , 'overall experience : disappointed' , 'use the app : love the app'",01/04/2019,2,0.21

I feel like they have tried every underhand trick in the book. Now the redemption is finally paid last week they have contacted me today to advise that as I cancelled my direct debit with them they can not close my account. They want me to pay them the next month's payment (even though I am no longer with them) so they can calculate costs and pay me back the difference. Surely that's what the redemption statement is for, so even though I am no longer with them I am still having to speak with them to resolve this as they have threatened me with marks on my credit file even though the account is showing as all monies paid and in credit as I have paid additional fees in interest which was their fault due to lateness.

"Okay, but nothing special.. Just had my latest Atom savings account mature. This time I received several texts advising me it was coming to an end soon. 

Whilst informative, they are quite matter of fact. There seems little interest in trying to keep you as a customer. It advises that you can reinvest the amount or withdraw the money. With other companies I have accounts with, they're desperate to keep your money and business, and there is encouragement to stay and special offers. I thought Atom may have a current/loyal customer 'special' rate, but alas no, just a choose a new account or withdraw your money. I find it a little strange that Atom don't seem to be fussed either way!? 

My last 2 savings accounts matured and were moved out, as Atom were offering below par rates, and this account has followed and I've moved this account out too. I have another 2 accounts maturing over the next few months, and with Atom offering rates similar or below other companies, these will be moved as well. 

I can't say that I've ever felt truly valued as an Atom customer.  Just money paid in, then text a year or 2 later when near expiry with a take it leave it. It would be nice if there was an existing customer account you were offered with a better rate.

"Terrible app and no HMRC tax certificates. I have an Atom Bank account which I took out because of the best interest rates at the time.
The app has always been awful and more like a game. Why on earth should a pin take time for them to verify and the Face ID pretty duff.
Finding anything in the app is difficult but for the sake of high interest, such as it is, I waited for the end of term which is tomorrow.
O happy day!
Anyway and mindful of filling in my tax I always file the tax certificate ready for the great event and ALL other banks provide this certificate which of course shows zero tax but gives the total interest for the year, essential for tax computation. Not so Atom who give a statement of closing the account with individual interest payments.
Atom will be stuffed if JC gets in methinks when tax at source is a distinct possibility again.
If Atom are prepared, like all other banks, then their back office would just roll out the certificates.
Enough of all these games and I will be off!",-0.26,"'accounts : bank account' , 'app design : difficult to use' , 'authentication : face recognition' , 'register : identity' , 'interest rates : interest paid' , 'app quality : poor app' , 'overall experience : waiting'",14/09/2019,1,-0.26

Despite two or three times of trying, I simply cannot get the facial recognition bit to work, neither can my Wife. We have followed, precisely, their “ensure well lit” instructions, but to no avail. In order to try again, they have to delete ALL other login data types as well, which means you have to set up everything all over again - why can’t we just redo the facial bit ??

Then, a minor gripe - I really do wish that they offered a fixed rate ISA account as well because it’s good to try and keep as much interest as possible outside the tax system.
