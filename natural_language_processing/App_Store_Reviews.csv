"The chat facility is poor as it's hidden beneath my keyboard so I'm typing blind. Whilst receptive the Atom staff have failed to resolve this issue. If you are an Internet bank then the chat facility needs to be spot on and cater for all phones and keyboards. In addition this app eats power. None of my other apps are as power hungry.

"This is one of the worst apps I have come across. Besides the horrible security features the main issue is that they are trying to be so fancy with the UI they make it nearly impossible to use. Things that could fit on a single screen force you to scroll. Instead of having a button to continue they have an unusual colour area/bar/shape that appears suddenly when it considers the form complete. One of the issues with that is that you can't tell if you need to scroll further down or are missing something or what. (Note to Atom: never hide interactions, disable them instead) Because the whole form does not appear on a single screen you can never tell where you missed an input or where your error occurred. They should really stop trying to be fancy and create an app that just works. Probably why it is slow as well.  The issues with security are also annoying. I do not and will not trust face or voice instead of a password. Bio-metrics is fine for identifying who you are but it should never be used for authentication or authorization.

"BEWARE it only works on one device!. Having been using internet banking since it started, I am used to accessing my accounts on the phone, tablet and desktop. Atom advertise themselves as a mobile only bank, so I assumed that once I'd set it up on my tablet (as it's bigger and easier to enter codes and type stuff in) I'd be able to open the app on the phone and access it there. NO. You can't do that. All you get when you open the app on the phone is 'explore app', no 'Log in'. 

Had a laborious 'chat' session with them and found that it only works with the device you set the account up on, and they are working on making it accessible across devices, with no timescale.

Looking at it now, it appears that the deposit window is now a WEEK after opening the account (much better), with the limit of £100k in one account, should you so wish. This suggests to me that the banking side of it has been poorly thought out too, and they've had to lengthen the deposit window from a day to a week.

"Terrible App hinders promising service. Atom provides a service that seems promising. Given the excellent interest rates offered Iâ€™d love to have an app that I find bearable to use.

Unfortunately, the app has been a mess since I started using it almost two years ago and has seen very little improvement. Iâ€™ve provided feedback to Atom in the past, often being told that the changes were coming soon, and yet nothing has happened. For a bank thatâ€™s so lauded in the press, it makes an astonishingly bad app.

Some quick feedback off the top of my head:

- No support for TouchID
- Dreadful performance on lower specced phones including rapid battery drain
- No support for VoiceOver (not even the barebones support that pretty much every app has since itâ€™s built into the iOS frameworks)
- No support for Dynamic Type
- Frequent use of low contrast designs and tiny text
- Inability to edit text using the standard iOS reticule
- Items in the Vault are poorly named
- No respect for the Reduce Motion accessibility setting
- Often slow responses to taps that leave me wondering whether anythingâ€™s happening
- Incorrect bounce when scrolling
- When restoring iOS or upgrading to a new phone Iâ€™m always locked out, given a useless error and have to contact support. Last time I had to call and verify myself before re-registering and setting up my biometrics again. This time I just needed to uninstall and reinstall the app and then add a new device, but this is irritating and surely unnecessary given that no other app I use has such an issue.

"For an app-only bank the app is poor. For an app-only bank the app is really quite poor. It seems to have been designed primarily to make it fit the branding rather than to be usable and has some very basic bugs.

I wouldnâ€™t mind so much if there was any other way to interact with Atom Bank, but there isnâ€™t. If they donâ€™t make substantial improvements then next time itâ€™s time for me to remortgage Iâ€™ll probably go elsewhere.

Examples:

When I was chatting with an agent, it lost the chat connection and wouldnâ€™t let me continue to type while it was reconnecting. I had to close the app and log back in to get back into chat - and when I did this it had totally lost my previous conversation. An absolute pain.

It wouldnâ€™t let me download my mortgage offer application terms and conditions until after I had accepted them.

Reading my mortgage terms and conditions in the app was a pretty horrible experience. Thatâ€™s a LONG document and not well suited to reading on a mobile device in the format provided during the offer acceptance process.

Documents listed in the app are listed in some strange, undefined order, it only displays a handful of them by default, and I canâ€™t view really useful information for each of the documents, like date. I have multiple documents in there with the same name and I have no idea which is which. And itâ€™s an absolute pain to download them. 

The app logged me out automatically even though I was actively using it (reading my way through the terms and conditions). 

The log back in option doesnâ€™t work. I press the button and absolutely nothing happens.

Itâ€™s generally very laggy feeling. Logging in and navigating the app is very sluggish.

But most of all, itâ€™s just not very nice to use. It seems the designers were so fixated on their animated bubbles and unconventional layout that they totally forgot to make it easy and pleasant to use.

Before I downloaded the app I read the comments complaining about the face ID not working etc and was hesitant at first but when you download and register you will see that there are always 3 ways of logging in so even if the face ID is not recognising you (I never have problems with it), you can still sign in using a passnumber. So not sure what the moaning is all about. The design of the app is fun and I quite like it, whatâ€™s most important to me is that their interest rates are really great in comparison with mainstream banks.",,,,,0.11
"Terrible App - style over substance. I find this app pretty much impossible to use and navigate. Why canâ€™t you just put your password in and view your stuff?? Needlessly complicated, user interface design is awful, very unintuitive. Iâ€™ll definitely be using a different provider next time.",-0.67,"'app functionality : ui' , 'app quality : terrible app' , 'app design : style over substance'",02/10/2019,iOS,2.6.3,1,"Terrible App - style over substance.

"Good bank but awful app. I want to start by saying I am very happy with Atom bank; the account is good and customer service on the phone is excellent. However this has got to be the worst banking app out there. 

No support for Touch ID yet it uses other biometrics that take ages to get set up and seem less secure than Touch ID would be. Loading times are very slow compared to other banking apps. The animations/movement in the app are clunky and unnecessary. The UI is not particularly intuitive and it can be hard to find what you want from the menus.

In my opinion this needs a complete redesign. Devs please have a look at other mobile only banks like Starling and Monzo, you must be able to see the difference in performance, security and design between their apps and yours. This app feels like something from 10 years ago.",-0.32,"'banking services : banking apps' , 'app functionality : app set up' , 'app functionality : ui' , 'banking services : atom is a good bank' , 'customer support : customer service' , 'authentication : touch id' , 'app quality : terrible app' , 'app functionality : secure' , 'app functionality : slow'",12/10/2019,iOS,2.6.3,1,"Good bank but awful app. I want to start by saying I am very happy with Atom bank; the account is good and customer service on the phone is excellent.

"No issues at all. Been using Atom for almost a year on Apple platform. Great interest rates (important for me).  Had no issues opening account and getting app to function. Always 3 ways to login, yes Touch ID would be a useful feature but not overly important for me. Not had to use customer services yet and donâ€™t actually anticipate needing to. In summary, brilliant banking idea, great interest rates and great app. Thank you.",0.26,"'customer support : customer service' , 'app functionality : functionality of the app' , 'interest rates : good rate of interest' , 'app quality : great app' , 'authentication : touch id' , 'authentication : logging in'",25/10/2019,iOS,2.6.3,5,"No issues at all.

"For an app only bank; the app needs improvement. When moving to a new phone; the app forgets who you are and how to log you in. No other banking app does this. The only way to get around this is to sign out of iCloud Drive and turn off iPhone backup then either sign in or if that doesnâ€™t work re-register; at which point you will be signed in.

This is a terrible experience. The app is also slow and still reduces headphone volume to 50% when opened even though the app plays no sound.

Signing out of iCloud Drive will also mean that you lose your cards from ï£¿ Wallet. This has to be resolved and Apple have put methods in place to prevent all of these errors.",-0.34,"'banking services : banking apps' , 'app functionality : app improvements' , 'authentication : logging in' , 'app functionality : slow'",16/11/2019,iOS,2.6.3,2,"For an app only bank; the app needs improvement.
